# General

NorthernBUG returns with its 7th meeting after a COVID-19 holt. Yet, it comes back with strength, appetite and a new way of understanding gatherings.

NorthernBUG7 will be hosted this time as a hybrid event. While in-person attendees will have access to the collaborative nature of this community-led event, talks will also be streamed online, providing Q&A channels for virtual participants.

The meeting will start at 12 pm with a lunch, and finish at 5 pm, followed by drinks at a [local pub](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Norcroft+Centre,+University+of+Bradford,+Richmond+Rd,+Bradford+BD7+1DP/brewdog+bradford/@53.7916189,-1.763689,394m/data=!3m2!1e3!5s0x487be14a562e6349:0x3ad2e677d5931f01!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x487be6b5040ab98f:0x1527cafe37f4a936!2m2!1d-1.7645026!2d53.7924269!1m5!1m1!1s0x487be1393004e46f:0x55f0fd062a5f5695!2m2!1d-1.7579253!2d53.7914123).
