Big biological data analysis and storage are some of the biggest challenges
facing today's researchers and clinical scientists. NorthernBUG is a network of broadly defined bioinformaticians and users or bioinformatics services in the north of England. Inspired by Scottish NextGenBUG, we hold quarterly meetings, supported by The Genetics Society, to build a community of researchers and others using big data in biology. We strongly believe that NorthernBUG creates an important niche for researchers using computational techniques across the participating institutions and beyond. With its emphasis on practical and best practice, as well as allowing work-in-progress and informal exchange of information it is a unique source of support and a friendly peer network.

For a more detailed view of our meetings, please read this report for [The Genetics Society](https://genetics.org.uk) from [northernBUG 6 in Leeds](https://genetics.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Issue-85.pdf).
